TO DOs:
1. Fix spacing on heading for my headshot + intro (once I get a good background image)
2. "More" chevron - display + add click functionality
3. Nav - link click functionality + change color once I get a good background image + as scroll down, still appears on top
4. Resume - opens up in new tab
5. About - centered, spacing
6. Projects - image links to project page, fix sizing on the images, fix sizing on each box, fix alignment on the text and button. make all 3 same size
7. Pick a new theme color - not orange
8. Contact Form - connect to a database? or email me.
9. May need contrast between footer and contact form
